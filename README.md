# CIFAR_CNN
Over time, neural networks have demonstrated impressive results in various domains. However, simple classification networks often struggle to perform well despite being the most basic type of neural architecture. This challenge arises because these networks tend to learn "proxy features" rather than the true, relevant features of the data. As a result, they fail to capture the major characteristics associated with the task, leading to suboptimal performance.

This repo will try to learn CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to approach accuraces above 99 for CIFAR-10 and 95% for CIFAR-100. And all teh concludions will be added with explaination about the what teh convolutional neural network are trying to learn
